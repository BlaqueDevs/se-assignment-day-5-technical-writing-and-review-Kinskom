## SE-DAY5-Technical-Writing
## 1. Why does knowing your audience’s expertise matter?
Because if you talk to tech experts like they’re beginners, they’ll get bored. If you talk to beginners like they’re experts, they’ll get lost. You have to hit the right balance so people stay engaged and actually understand what you’re saying.

## 2. How do you tailor content for different people?
For experts: Get to the point, use industry terms, and skip the basics.
For non-experts: Keep it simple, explain things in everyday language, and give real-world examples.
## 3. How do you figure out what your audience already knows?
Ask them! If you’re in person, just say, “Are you familiar with [topic]?”
If you’re writing, assume they know a little, then gradually introduce more detail.
Watch for confusion—blank stares mean you need to simplify.
## 4. How do you make complex stuff easier to understand?
Use normal words (like "send" instead of "transmit data packet").
Explain things step by step, like you’re walking them through it.
Add visuals—people love a good diagram or example.
## 5. Why ditch jargon?
Because not everyone speaks “tech.” If you say “instantiate an object,” half your audience checks out. If you say “create something new,” they get it.

## 6. Example of simplifying terms:
Complicated: "Initiate the installation process."
Better: "Start installing."
Even better: "Click here to install."
## 7. Why do examples and visuals help?
Because people process pictures faster than words. Saying “a CPU is like a brain” is way easier to understand than explaining transistors and logic gates.

## 8. What types of visuals work best?
Flowcharts for processes.
Diagrams for explaining parts of a system.
Screenshots for tutorials.
## 9. Why are headings and subheadings important?
They break things up so people don’t feel like they’re reading a giant wall of text.

## 10. How do you make good headings?
Keep them short and clear.
Make them descriptive (instead of “Overview,” try “How This Works”).
Use subheadings to organize sections.
## 11. What should a ReadMe introduction say?
It should immediately tell people:

What the product does.
Who it’s for.
Why they should care.
## 12. How do you quickly explain a product?
Think of how you'd describe it in one tweet. For example:
"This app lets you track expenses easily, syncs with your bank, and gives you insights on your spending."
